## ðŸŒŸ Business Case

Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. While moderate coffee consumption has been linked to health benefits, excessive intake can affect sleep quality, increase stress, and pose potential health risks.  

This project provides a practical tool for both individuals and health practitioners to:

- Understand coffee consumption patterns.
- Predict sleep quality and stress level based on lifestyle factors.
- Evaluate potential health risks related to coffee habits.
